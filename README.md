# Direct detection limits

This is a repository to store and plot direct detection upper limits, projections and, one day, discoveries. 
All files should be stored in `.csv` format. Also, details about the content of each file should be
stored in `data/result_metadata.toml`. See `notebooks/` for examples on
how to plot the data stored in this repository.
